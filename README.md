**Line Follower Robot with Obstacle Avoidance**

This robot follows a black line and avoids obstacles. It was assembled using the video tutorial below:

## **Project Description**

This project is an autonomous mobile robot that moves along a black line using infrared sensors.
If an obstacle appears in its path, the robot detects it, performs an avoidance maneuver, and then returns back to the line.

P.S. 
In our project, we added an additional feature — a **Bluetooth module** that allows the robot to be controlled using **voice commands through a smartphone**.
This expands the robot’s capabilities: it can operate in **autonomous mode** (following the line) as well as in **manual mode**, where voice commands control its movement **to the left, right, forward, and backward**.
